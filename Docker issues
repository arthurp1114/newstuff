Using nsenter to enter specific container:
  sudo docker ps -a
  sudo docker inspect --format "{{ .State.Pid }}" <container-id> --> This will return a PID for the next $PID
  sudo nsenter --target $PID --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid


Private Registry:
  Got erros like "v1 ping attempt failed with error: Get https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxx/v1/_ping: EOF.
                  If this private registry supports only HTTP or HTTPS with an unknown CA certificate, 
                  please add `--insecure-registry 74.208.174.3:5000` to the daemon's arguments. In the case 
                  of HTTPS, if you have access to the registry's CA certificate, no need for the flag; 
                  simply place the CA certificate at /etc/docker/certs.d/74.208.174.3:5000/ca.crt" during the push process.
  Solution:
    Go to modify /etc/sysconfig/docker and add this:
    other_args="--insecure-registry xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxx" at the client machine then restart the docker service.
