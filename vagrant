Got error messages like when running the command "vagrant reload":

  Failed to mount folders in Linux guest. This is usually because
  the "vboxsf" file system is not available. Please verify that
  the guest additions are properly installed in the guest and
  can work properly. The command attempted was:

  mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`getent group vagrant | cut -d: -f3` vagrant /vagrant
  mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`id -g vagrant` vagrant /vagrant

  The error output from the last command was:

  stdin: is not a tty
  mount: unknown filesystem type 'vboxsf'
  
To fix this, run the following command

  sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-utils
  
in guest OS.
