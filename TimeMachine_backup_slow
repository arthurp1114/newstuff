put the following command when the time machine backup stuck:

Unload spotlight first:

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist

After the backup completes, load the spotlight again

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.pli
